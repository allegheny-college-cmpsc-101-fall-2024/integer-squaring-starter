# Integer Squaring

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## Add Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

TODO: run the commands shown below and copy in the output in fenced code blocks.
Please make sure that the fenced code block is designated as coming from the
terminal shell (```shell).
TODO: Make an H3 heading for **each** command that identifies what the
command uniquely demonstrates compared to the others.

- `poetry run square --approach for --directory input --file numbers.txt`
- `poetry run square --approach while --directory input --file numbers.txt`

### Short Summary of Program Output

TODO: Verify that both commands produce the same output. Use an itemized
list to give the first three squared integers
produced as output by the final implementation of your program. Itemized
lists have a particular syntax in Markdown - Google as needed.

## 2. Source Code and Configuration Files

### A function that confirms that a file containing data is valid

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code mentioned in the
heading above. Make sure that your fenced code block is designated to contain
Python (```python). Then, write one paragraph to explain the source code.

### A function that squares an integer using a `for` loop

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code mentioned in the
heading above. Make sure that your fenced code block is designated to contain
Python. Then, write one paragraph to explain the source code.

### A function that square an integer using a `while` loop

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code mentioned in the
heading above. Make sure that your fenced code block is designated to contain
Python. Then, write one paragraph to explain the source code.

### An enumeration class that defines the options for squaring an integer

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the source code mentioned in the
heading above. Make sure that your fenced code block is designated to contain
Python. Then, write one paragraph to explain the source code.
